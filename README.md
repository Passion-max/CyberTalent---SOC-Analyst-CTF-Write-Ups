# CyberTalent - SOC Analyst CTF Write Ups

Welcome to my repository of writeups for the CyberTalent Blue Team Scholarship 2023 Certified SOC Analyst CTF challenges. 

## Purpose

The aim of this project is not only to demonstrate my problem-solving ability and technical knowledge but also to explain how each challenge relates to the real-world tasks performed by a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst. 

Each writeup follows a consistent format, detailing the tools used, my thought process and methodologies in solving the challenge, and reflections on the learning outcomes from the perspective of a SOC analyst.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by categories of challenges, each in their own top-level folder. For instance, `web_security` or `network_security`. Each individual challenge is then contained in a separate folder within the relevant category, including the following files:

- `README.md`: This is the main writeup document for the challenge, divided into several sections:

  1. **Challenge**: A description of the challenge and what it involves.
  
  2. **Tool Used and About Them**: An explanation of any tools used to solve the challenge, including background information about these tools.

  3. **Thought Process and Methodologies**: A walk-through of the steps taken to solve the challenge, highlighting my thought process and the methodologies used.

  4. **Learning and Reflections (SOC Analyst Perspective)**: Reflections on the challenge from a SOC Analyst perspective. This section will tie the challenge back to the tasks a SOC Analyst might perform in their role, and highlight any learnings or insights gained.

- `assets`: A folder that contains any images, diagrams, or code snippets referenced in the writeup.

## Contributing
